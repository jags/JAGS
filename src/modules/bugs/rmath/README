This is a partial copy of the Rmath library that is part of R.

The API has been modified for the random number generators. These
now take, as argument, a pointer to an opaque struct RNG which
encapsulates the state of the random number generator.

Apart from that, nothing is changed, so it should be fairly 
straigthforward to resynchronise this library with R. The
current version comes from R 2.3.0.

The file callbacks.cc is a C++ source file that translates the
functions unif_rand, norm_rand and exp_rand into member function
calls for the class RNG.
