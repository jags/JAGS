This is JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), a program for analysis of
Bayesian Graphical models by Gibbs Sampling. 

The functionality of JAGS is based on the BUGS program created by the
MRC Biostatistics Unit (http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk). There is a short
manual that describes the differences between JAGS and BUGS.
